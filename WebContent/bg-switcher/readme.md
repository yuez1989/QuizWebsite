How to use
----------

Use any element as the container for the images and call the plugin from this element as jQuery object. Everything including the array with image urls is passed as an options object.

```javascript
  var srcBgArray = [
    "/path/to/image1.jpg",
    "/path/to/image2.jpg",
    "/path/to/image3.jpg"
  ];
  
  $(document).ready(function() {
    $('#bg-body').bcatBGSwitcher({
      urls: srcBgArray,
      alt: 'Alt text'
    });
  });
```

Full screen functionality is handled entirely by the CSS, so if you want the full screen feature to work, download the whole package and take a look at the bare bones style.css.
